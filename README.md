# devboi (Dwaine Gallimore) Personal Blog

Start of something new..

I have been constantly battling with how i want to start a new blog. I have made the decison that i want to development my skills and knowledge in software enginering and development and i seems to be at odds with myself on where to start. I am like a chaotic mind jumping from stars to stars in a massive galaxy.

I went to visit family this weekend (21/05/2022) and while on a walk, my brother (step brother - so to speak) said to me. If you find it dificult starting to write why not simply approach it like you are talking to a person, same as i was talking to them on the walk. And so here i am having a conversation with you.

## Getting some direction

I need to stop overthinking and jumping on the next best thing and just start doing. So at this moment i am going to say i need to approach things in the following order

- Get blogging site up and running
- Start on one project (EVA), well continue ;)
- Blog about the journey, what ive learnt etc.

Thats it, simple.

I guess when you put pen to paper (stylus to iPad), or simply keyboard to screen. The problem dont seem so big. :)
